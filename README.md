## A Cool Space Invaders Game

### Description

This is a nice space invaders game I made in my spare time. I didn't add any function to keep the frame rate down for faster computers, but I added a text box where you type in a delay (in milliseconds) to keep the speed of the game down on faster computers. To play, use all the arrow keys to go up, down, left, & right and use the space bar to shoot. Over time, if you have enough kills, you will start to get special powers :)
